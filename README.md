**Turning Business Data into Smart Decisions - A Student Project**

</div>

## 📖 What's This About?

Hello! I'm Gomezgani Chirwa, a 3rd-year Management Information Systems (MIS) student at MUBAS. This dashboard is my main project for the Programming III module (CIS-PRO-313), but it's really about something bigger.

While talking to small shop owners in my community, I kept hearing the same frustration: "I know the money is moving, but I can't see where it's going." They were drowning in paper receipts, struggling with mental inventory counts and making crucial decisions based on guesswork. As someone training to bridge business and technology, that felt like a problem waiting for a solution.

So, I decided to build one. This isn't just another coding exercise for a grade. It's my attempt to apply what I'm learning in class to a real challenge faced by Malawian businesses. Can a simple, clear dashboard replace a messy spreadsheet and give an owner back control? I'm building this to find out.

## 🎓 How This Connects to My Studies

This year semester 1 at MUBAS, I'm taking 6 modules. This project uses something from each one:

| Subject | What I Used Here |
|---------|------------------|
| **Programming III** | Python, Flask, making everything work together |
| **Database Admin** | MySQL database design, making it fast and secure |
| **Financial Accounting** | Profit/loss reports, balance sheet views |
| **Computer Graphics** | Charts and data visualizations |
| **Operating Systems** | Making it run smoothly on servers |
| **Research Methods** | Testing with users, documenting everything |

## ✨ What Can This Dashboard Do?

### For Business Owners:
- **See sales right now** - No waiting for end-of-month reports
- **Know what's in stock** - Get warnings before you run out
- **Understand customers** - See who buys most and when
- **Track money** - Income, expenses, and profits all in one place

### Technical Stuff I Implemented:
- **Live updates** - Data refreshes every few minutes
- **Secure login** - Different views for managers and staff
- **PDF reports** - One-click download for meetings
- **Mobile friendly** - Check your business from your phone
- **Backup system** - Automatic daily database backups

## 📸 See It in Action

## 🛠️ How to Set It Up (For Developers)

If you're a student or developer who wants to run this locally:

### What You Need First:
- Python 3.9 or higher
- MySQL installed on your computer
- Git (to download the project)

### Step-by-Step Installation:

```bash
# 1. Get the code
git clone https://github.com/Kafuvula/business-intelligence-dashboard.git
cd business-intelligence-dashboard

# 2. Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Make sure WAMP is running and MySQL is available
#    WAMP should show the green icon and MySQL should be up.

# 4. Set up the database and load sample data
python setup_db.py

# 5. Run the application
python run.py

# 6. Open in browser
# Go to: http://localhost:5000

```

Default Login (for testing):
Admin: admin@business.com / admin123
Manager: manager@business.com / admin123
Staff: staff@business.com / admin123

(Change these immediately if deploying for real use!)

🔧 What I'm Working On Now
This Week's Goals:
Set up basic Flask application
Create database tables
Design main dashboard layout
Add sales chart
Create login system
Write tests for core features

Coming Soon:
Email alerts for low stock
Customer loyalty tracking
Expense categorization
Multi-business support (for franchises)

For fellow MUBAS students:
If you're working on something similar or need help with your projects, feel free to reach out. We can learn together!

🚀 What I've Learned So Far
Building this has taught me:
Planning matters - I spent 2 days just designing the database before writing any code
Small steps win - Instead of building everything at once, I add one feature at a time
Testing saves time - Writing tests feels slow but catches bugs early
Documentation is key - If I don't write it down, I forget why I did something

📚 Challenges I Faced (And How I Solved Them)
Problem 1: Making Data Update Live
Challenge: How to show new sales without refreshing the page
Solution: Used JavaScript to fetch data every 5 minutes

Problem 2: Slow Database Queries
Challenge: Loading all sales history took 10+ seconds
Solution: Added database indexes and cached frequent queries

Problem 3: Different User Views
Challenge: Managers need full access, staff need limited view
Solution: Created role-based permissions system

🎯 My Goals for This Project
Academic: Demonstrate a deep, practical understanding of full-stack development for my Programming III (CIS-PRO-313) assessment.

Portfolio: Create a substantial, working project that I can show to potential employers or clients as proof of my skills.

Learning: Move from understanding concepts in isolation to knowing how to architect and deploy a complete, integrated system.

Impact: Create a tool that is genuinely useful. If even one small business owner finds it helpful, I'll consider that a huge success.
